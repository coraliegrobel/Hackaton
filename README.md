This code take a file.xlsx that come from a survey. It is used to estimate the risk for the society if you are uncontained. 
It will use Gauss's law to calculate the score of each subject that complete the form. By using that we ponder every response for each
question to avoid that our subjectivity count for too much. We tried to put real probability for each question, found on real source.

To test it you can download evrything and use the file final.xlsx. You will have to launch the file processing_data. Then you will have to launch the file etude_personne. You will obtain with the fist code the score of each people and then with the second code you will obtain the histogram of the distribution of the score of each people.
